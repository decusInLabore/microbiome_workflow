## TECHNICAL CHECKS

Quality Control (QC)

You may want to start by reviewing the quality of the underlying RNA and RNA-sequencing. This is done in the Quality control (QC) section. Things to look for are the percentage of reads that aligned to intergenic regions (indicating DNA contamination in your RNA) and the sequence duplication rate (which might be a PCR artefact introduced during sample amplification and may affect the complexity of the sequenced library).
